THEMAS 1.2 Release Notes
=============================================================================
- Update to Java 8 / Neo4j 3.2.5 / Neo4j-sisapi 1.2
- Each Term/TopTerm/Facet created is assigned a reference Id unique per thesaurus
  and a transliteration of the logicalname according to configurations in config.xml.
  This transliteration will be used for custom sorting and case&tone incensitive search.
  (Transliteration request occurred as a result of the need to support polytonic greek punctuation)
- Each XML exported contains the referenceId added to each term
- SKOS export now uses this reference Id instead of a random number or the first taxonomical code
- XMLStream mode was added so that External Readers (if having access) can retrieve 
  thesaurus data in XML format with a simple http request  
- Contains search uses the transliteration field whenever referring to Terms/Hierarchies/Facets
- resolved bug with starts with operator
- Added "Chosen" javascript plugin to html select elements where user has to select from long lists (the bts, rts etc.)

THEMAS 1.0 Release Notes
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The THEMAS system (Thesaurus Management System) is a Web 
based graphical interface for creating and managing multi-
faceted multilingual thesauri with Greek or English language 
serving as the dominant language and a configurable number 
of reference translation languages. Neo4j open source graph 
database (http://neo4j.com/) is used in the backend for data 
storage, Neo4j-sisapi v1.0 (https://github.com/isl/Neo4j-sisapi/tree/v1.0) 
for the interaction with the database and TELOS [1,2,3] 
representation language stuctures are used as reference for 
the thesauri structure.

The underlying Neo4j Database works in embedded mode and 
the neo4j jar files used for the database access come from
the Neo4j graph database version 2.2.5 community edition.

The Data Model used in Neo4j database follows the Telos language 
representational framework specifications where the following 
implementation decisions were made:

- One Neo4j Node is created for each of the 4 Telos building blocks 
  (Individual class, Individual Token, Attribute Class, Attribute Token)
  
- Each Node has one and unique Neo4j Id and one Logical name which is not
  necessarily unique

- Level and Type of each TELOS building block are stored as Neo4j Labels
  
- Instance Of, Isa, From and To relations from Telos are stored as Neo4j Relationships
  
- Primitive Values (and Types) are stored as Neo4j Properties in Attribute Nodes
