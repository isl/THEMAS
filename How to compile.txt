How to compile
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Create a java web application project (JEE 7 Web)
until now we used java jdk1.7.0_51 64 bit
and Apache Tomcat 8.0.23

- Use the sources included in the /Sources/WebApplication/ 
  folder of this repository
  
- Create the following empty folders in case they do not exist
  -- web\help-files
  -- web\LogFiles
  -- web\MonitorAutomaticBackups
  -- web\Save_Results_Displays\Save_Results_temporary_files
  -- web\SVGproducer\SVG_temporary_files
  -- web\third-party-javascript
  -- web\third-party-javascript\mktree
  -- web\third-party-javascript\wztooltip
  -- web\third-party-javascript\ckeditor
  -- web\Uploads
  -- web\WEB-INF\SystemLogs


- Download the third party javascript files or use the copies provided at 
  libs\Javascript folder and place them in:
   
  -- web/third-party-javascript/mktree and 
  -- web/third-party-javascript/wztooltip and
  -- web/third-party-javascript/ckeditor  respectively
     
- Configure wz_tooltip.js:
     var ttBorderColor = "#000000";
     var ttFontColor   = "#898B5E";
     var ttWidth       = 250;

- Get all the jar files included in THEMAS-Dependencies-LicensesUsed.txt
  -- For neo4j jar files you can just obtain the zip file of 
     Neo4j Community edition version 2.2.5 or perhaps later 
     and get the jar files from it's lib folder
     
  -- Neo4j-sisapi-1.0.jar, commons-fileupload-1.0.jar and kxml2-2.3.0.jar 
     copies can be found in libs folder 
     Neo4j-sisapi-1.0.jar can be build from sources found in (https://github.com/isl/Neo4j-sisapi/tree/v1.0)
  
- create project references to these libraries


- Apply jvm option -Dfile.encoding=UTF8


You must now be able to compile


The neo4j database needs no installation. 
Copy contents of /Sources/THEMAS_DB_FOLDER
to any folder of your machine and refer to it 
in file:

"/Sources/WebApplication/web/DBadmin/tms_db_admin_config_files/config.xml"

by changing the "Neo4j_DB_FOLDER_PATH" xml element text



In order to define as primary language the English language
then you also need to make the folowing confugurations:

In File:
"/Sources/WebApplication/web/DBadmin/tms_db_admin_config_files/config.xml"
replace:

    <PrimaryLanguage>Greek</PrimaryLanguage>
    <PrimaryLanguagePrefix>EL</PrimaryLanguagePrefix>	
    <UnclassifiedTermsHierarchyName>Ορφανοί όροι</UnclassifiedTermsHierarchyName>
    <Neo4j_SpecificTSVFile>\TSVs\System\Specific_el.tsv</Neo4j_SpecificTSVFile>
with 

		<PrimaryLanguage>English</PrimaryLanguage>
    <PrimaryLanguagePrefix>EN</PrimaryLanguagePrefix>
    <UnclassifiedTermsHierarchyName>Unclassified terms</UnclassifiedTermsHierarchyName>
    <Neo4j_SpecificTSVFile>\TSVs\System\Specific_en.tsv</Neo4j_SpecificTSVFile>
    


In order to change the UIlanguage to english (It is irrelevant to the 
language used as primary in the database) you should edit file: 
"Sources/WebApplication/web/WEB-INF/web.xml" 
and replace:

		<context-param>
        <param-name>UILanguage</param-name>
        <param-value>el</param-value>
    </context-param>
    
with:

		<context-param>
        <param-name>UILanguage</param-name>
        <param-value>en</param-value>
    </context-param>



Finally Edit File "Sources/WebApplication/web/WEB-INF/classes/logging.properties
so that logfile folder and log file prefix are correctly set

e.g.
org.apache.juli.FileHandler.directory = ${catalina.base}/webapps/THEMAS/WEB-INF/SystemLogs/
org.apache.juli.FileHandler.prefix = THEMASLogs_



In order to save Greek data in viewable format for XML files in fields that we use CKEditor
we have to add one parameter to ckeditor config file.
- Path for the config file is : "ckeditor/config.js"
- Parameter to add in the end of file (parameter without quotes in config file): "config.entities_greek = false;" 

Behavior of the Enter key while typing in CKEditor is set to mode CKEDITOR.ENTER_BR (2) which means that lines are broken with <br> elements. To use this mode or any mode have to add a parameter in ckeditor config file.
- Path for the config file is : "ckeditor/config.js"
- Parameter to add in the end of file (parameter without quotes in config file): "config.enterMode = 2;"
