<b>Cookies Policy</b>
<p>During &nbsp;visitors&rsquo;/users&rsquo; navigation on this website, FORTH may collect identification data of users, by using relevant technologies, such as cookies and/or Internet Protocol (IP) address monitoring. Cookies are small text segments that are sent to the browser by a website visited by the user.

You may delete all cookies from your computer and, in most browsers, select settings that do not allow installation of cookies. However, in that case, you may have to adjust certain preferences every time you visit a website. Users may make use of the website without problems even without use of cookies, but, potentially, to the detriment of its user-friendliness and of the functioning of certain of its services.<br />Any personal data collected via cookies that can be correlated to a specific visitor/user shall be processed exclusively for the purposes cited above.</p>

Access to these data is provided to very few officers of the organisation, who have been bound to keeping confidentiality. Moreover, we have adequate security systems and take all necessary and appropriate organisational and technical measures in order to prevent any breach of personal data security (leak, disclosure, unauthorised access) in our systems.</p>
