<b>Purpose and Principles of Personal Data Collection</b>

<p>FORTH collects and processes the personal data of visitors/users exclusively and only with a view to
meeting its purposes and functions and, more specifically, for the purpose of its communication with
you. Processing is limited to personal data that are necessary and appropriate for meeting the purpose
and functions of the website. Processing is subject to the requirements of the General Data Protection
Regulation and the relevant Union law, Greek legislation and international conventions and treaties.</p>

<b>Use of the Personal Data Collected by Us</b>

<p>The personal data we collect from the contact platform available on our website, as well as any other
data that may be sent to us through our profiles on the various social networks, shall be used only for
the needs of our communication with you and for your better service. While navigating on our website,
cookies are used only for the purpose of statistical analysis of the visits to our website. No further
processing, transmission or exchange of these data shall take place. In any event, you are a priori
requested to consent to the above use of your personal data. </p>

<b>Cookies Policy</b>

<p>During users’ navigation on this website, FORTH may collect identification data of users, by using
relevant technologies, such as cookies and/or Internet Protocol (IP) address monitoring. Cookies are
small text segments that are sent to the browser by a website visited by the user. The use of cookies
helps the website to remember information about the user’s visit, such as your preferred language and
your preferences, to make secure searches, to calculate the number of visitors, or to facilitate your
registration in our services.</p>
<p>
<b>How to control cookies:</b>
You may control and/or delete cookies as you wish. You may find more details at aboutcookies.org. You may delete all cookies from your computer and, in most browsers, select settings that do not allow installation of cookies. However, in that case, you may have to adjust certain preferences every time you visit a website. Users may make use of the website without problems even without use of cookies, but, potentially, to the detriment of its user-friendliness and of the functioning
of certain of its services.
Any personal data collected via cookies that can be correlated to a specific visitor/user shall be
processed exclusively for the purposes cited above.</p>
